MIPS-Datapath is a graphical MIPS simulator written by Andrew Gascoyne-Cecil.

MIPS-Datapath supports a small subset of the full MIPS instruction set. The flow of data within a graphical representation of a MIPS simulator can be displayed in one of three modes: simplified, pipelined, and data forwarding. MIPS-Datapath is designed as a tool for learning about how processors work from the ground up.

The application uses wxWidgets for a cross-platform graphical user interface. (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)

Development of this program requires the wxWidgets and GLUT development libraries to be installed.
